#' Save R objects to an RData file on Slack
#'
#' `slackr_save` enables you upload R objects (as an R data file)
#' to Slack and (optionally) post them to one or more channels
#' (if `channels` is not empty).
#'
#' @param ... objects to store in the R data file.
#' @param channels Comma-separated list of channel names or IDs where the file will be shared.
#' @param file filename (without extension) to use.
#' @param token Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.
#' @param initial_comment The message text introducing the file in specified channels.
#' @param thread_ts Provide another message's ts value to upload this file as a reply. Never use a reply's ts value; use its parent instead.
#' @param title Title of file.
#' @return `httr` response object from `POST` call
