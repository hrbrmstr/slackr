slackr - a package to send full & webhook API messages to Slack.com channels/users

Slackr contains functions that make it possible to interact with slack messaging platform. When you need to share information/data from R, rather than resort to copy/paste in e-mails or other services like Skype, you can use this package to send well-formatted output from multiple R objects and expressions to all teammates at the same time with little effort. You can also send images from the current graphics device. , R objects (as RData), and upload files.

### News

-   Version `1.2.2` fixed [issue](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/slackr/issues/4) (bug in `1.2.1` fix)
-   Version `1.2.1` fixed [issue](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/slackr/issues/3) when there are no private groups defined
-   Version `1.2` re-introduced `ggslackr()` (first [CRAN version](http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/packages/slackr/index.html))
-   Version `1.1.1` fixed a bug in the new full API `slackr()` function
-   Version `1.1` added graphics & files capability
-   Version `1.0` released

The following functions are implemented:

-   `slackrSetup` : initialize necessary environment variables
-   `slackr` : send stuff to `slack.com` (full API token - i.e. not webhook - required)
-   `slackrBot` : send stuff to `slack.com` using the incoming webhook API/token
-   `dev.slackr` : send the graphics contents of the current device to a to `slack.com` channel (full API token - i.e. not webhook - required)
-   `ggslackr` : send a ggplot object to a `slack.com` channel (no existing device plot required, useful for scripts) (full API token - i.e. not webhook - required)
-   `save.slackr` : save R objects to an RData file on `slack.com` (full API token - i.e. not webhook - required)
-   `slackrUpload` : upload any file to `slack.com` (full API token - i.e. not webhook - required)
-   `slackrUsers` : get a data frame of `slack.com` users (full API token - i.e. not webhook - required)
-   `slackrChannels` : get a data frame of `slack.com` channels (full API token - i.e. not webhook - required)
-   `slackrGroups` : get a data frame of `slack.com` groups (full API token - i.e. not webhook - required)

The `slackrSetup()` function will try to read setup values from a `~/.slackr` (you can change the default) configuration file, which may be easier and more secure than passing them in manually (plus, will allow you to have multiple slackr configs for multiple Slack.com teams). The file is in Debian Control File (DCF) format since it really doesn't need to be JSON and R has a handy `read.dcf()` function since that's what `DESCRIPTION` files are coded in. Here's the basic format for the configuration file:

    token: YOUR_INCOMING_WEBHOOK_TOKEN
    channel: #general
    username: slackr
    incoming_webhook_url: https://YOUR_TEAM.slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?
    api_token: YOUR_FULL_API_TOKEN

You can also change the default emoji icon (from the one you setup at integration creation time) with `icon_emoji`.
